#Neuron Mimic


This app mimics the neuron behavior in the learning process of NAND Action

##Values
- Speed learning: 8
- Threshold: 0.5
- The initiate Weight Vector: [0.7, 0.4, 0.7]

##Usage
What you have to do is to run the app and the draw of the vectors will appear every 0.2 sec until the system found the values of the weight vector that separate the two class of the NAND Action

##X_INPUTS

- X0 binary input value (constant)
- X1 binary input value
- X2 binary input value

##Desired output
